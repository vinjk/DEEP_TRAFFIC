MIT 6.S094 Deep Learning for Self Driving Cars

DeepTraffic Project, where we get to play with the parameters to train a Reinforcement 
Learning network to make our car (agent) move at the fastest possible speed, navigating 
the traffic without collision.

DeepTraffic is a deep reinforcement learning competition. The goal is to create a
 neural network to drive a vehicle (or multiple vehicles) as fast as possible through 
dense highway traffic.
